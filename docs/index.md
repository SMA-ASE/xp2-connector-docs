# SMA OpCon XP2 Connector

SMA has developed several scripts to interface with the XP2 software from FiServ. This allows the power of OpCon to be utilized by Credit Unions running this software package. Some of these scripts must be started by CreateXPEnvForPerl.ksh. If this is the case, it will be indicated in the description of the script.
